### Welcome to Red Team Ops II

![[1. Course Introduction.png]]

This course is designed to be a continuation of [Red Team Ops](https://training.zeropointsecurity.co.uk/courses/red-team-ops) and aims to build on the fundamentals covered there.  Although not mandatory, it's highly recommended to have completed RTO I as a prerequisite.  The primary focus of RTO II is to provide more advanced OPSEC tactics and defence bypass strategies.
