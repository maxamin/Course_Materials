The primary support channel is via the [Zero-Point Security Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Whz3YtY4gG).  You may add yourself to the private student channel by using the **!roles** command (assuming HAL isn't on strike).

There is also the [Red Team Operators Community](https://training.zeropointsecurity.co.uk/communities/Q29tbXVuaXR5LTIwMjMw) space, which is open to those enrolled on both RTO and RTO II.
