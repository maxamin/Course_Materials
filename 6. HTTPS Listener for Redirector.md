Once you've connected with the CS client, go to the **Listeners** menu and click **Add**.

Select the **Beacon HTTPS Payload** option.

When you create an HTTP listener, it will auto-populate the call-back hosts according to the IP address of the Team Server itself.  In this case, 10.10.0.69.  The issue being that nothing "external" can reach this IP, so any payloads generated with this configuration could never reach us.  In the real-world, under **HTTP Hosts** and **HTTPS Host (Stager)**, you would put your FQDN (e.g. acmecorp.uk in my case).  However, in the lab, we're stuck with putting the IP address of the redirector - **10.10.5.39**.

This will tell the payload that it needs to beacon to the redirector, and we're relying on the redirector to proxy the traffic to the Team Server.
