If you purchased the Course & Lab bundle, you can access the RTO II lab via the [Snap Labs Dashboard](https://dashboard.snaplabs.io/) where you will see a "Red Team Ops II Lab" event.

  During the first launch, **do not** attempt to shut the lab down until the overall lab status and every individual VM status says **Running**.
  
 Once running, the VM consoles can be access via the little monitor button.
